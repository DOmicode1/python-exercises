# TASKS (9p)

# 5 Create your own 3d function with multiple local optima.
# Create an algorithm which takes an initial point and looks for the closest local optimum (1p)
# Create an algorithm which aims to find a global optimum, the time of execution is limiter to ~30sec (1p)
# If your solution is heuristic test its quality. Measure the probability of finding the GLOBAL optimum (1p).
# You can, for example, execute your search function multiple times and check
# if the returned result is what you expected.
# Measure the success / total trials rate (2p).
